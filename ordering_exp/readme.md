ordering has been done by others
see wallace emnlp 2019

also ordering performance is poor
when k=1, test set acc(training and testing) is just higher than the average case(the expectation of the random direction on the test set) by about 1 point
maybe because the model, the direction mapping model, is too weak, thus underfitting...
