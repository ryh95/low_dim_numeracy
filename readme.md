TODO:

- [ ] add the introduction video of the paper

## How to run experiments?

Put embeddings in `data/embs/` dir to run `main.py` (pre-trained embeddings are described in the paper)

abstract="To reason over the embeddings of numbers, they should capture numeracy information. In this work, we consider the magnitude aspect of numeracy information. We could find a vector in a high dimensional space and a subspace of original space. After projecting the original embeddings of numbers onto that vector or subspace, the magnitude information could be significantly enhanced. Therefore, this paper proposes a new angle to study numeracy of word embeddings, which is interpretable and has nice mathematical formulations.",
