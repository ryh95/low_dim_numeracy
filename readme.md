This repository contains the code and data of the paper "Enhancing the Numeracy of Word Embeddings:
a Linear Algebraic Perspective"

TODO:

- [ ] add the paper link
- [ ] add the introduction video of the paper
- [ ] add the bib file

## How to run experiments?

Put embeddings in `data/embs/` dir to run `main.py` (pre-trained embeddings are described in the paper)
